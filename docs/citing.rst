Citation Guidelines
===================

When publishing work that uses ``lstid_processing``, please cite the package and
any package it depends on that plays an important role in your analysis.
Specifying which version of ``lstid_processing`` used will also improve the
reproducibility of your presented results.  We also recommend citing the
journal article that this package supported, unless the use of this package is
completely divorced from that context.
