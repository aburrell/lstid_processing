Overview
========

``lstid_processing`` is a repository designed to support an upcoming publication
that analysis Large-Scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (LSTIDs) in the
topside ionosphere.  These tools were developed to be used with C/NOFS CINDI,
DMSP, and SAMI3.  They may also be useful for other models and instruments.
