Package Interface
=================

This module contains code for analysing TIDs in the C/NOFS CINDI data and the
SAMI3 model.  The tools used in this analysis may prove useful for processing
in other instruments and models.  Model runs generated for studing LSTIDs are
included in the ``model_runs`` directory within this package.
